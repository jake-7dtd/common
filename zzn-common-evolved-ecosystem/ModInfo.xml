		<Description value="There is more variety in biome wildlife and you should expect some adventurous guests. Mountain lions seemingly feel at home in the desert now, amongst other changes. There are some live bears in the wasteland -- how would the zombie bears there come into being otherwise? Birds can sometimes spawn in all biomes; they were already present in many forest and snow POIs, now they can be met in the wild." />
